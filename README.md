# Data-Analysis-and-ML

My projects and checkpoints for the University of Edinburgh data analysis and machine learning (DAML) graduate course

In total I worked on 3 projects and 14 checkpoints. The projects were focused on exploring key stages of the particle physics analysis pipeline and are in the form of Jupyter Notebook reports. 
The checkpoints were based on self-contained analysis tasks that were explored along with the lectures.
